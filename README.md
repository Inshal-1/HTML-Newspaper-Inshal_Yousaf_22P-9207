## Project Description
This project recreates a pre-1990 Urdu newspaper front page using only HTML5. The layout was structured using semantic HTML elements and a table-based column design to resemble the original printed format. The content was translated from Urdu to English and rephrased in my own words while maintaining the original layout structure.

## Features Implemented
- Proper HTML5 document structure with <!DOCTYPE html>
- Semantic tags (<header>, <nav>, <article>, <section>, <footer>)
- 3-column layout using a table
- Multiple heading levels (h1–h4)
- Images with alt attributes
- Ordered/Unordered list
- Inline styling for alignment and formatting
- HTML comments explaining major sections

## Challenges Faced
One challenge was recreating the newspaper’s multi-column layout without using external CSS. I solved this by using an HTML table structure carefully aligned to match the original format. Another challenge was maintaining proper heading hierarchy while keeping visual similarity to the newspaper.
